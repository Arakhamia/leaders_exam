# Problem 9: The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) - 10áƒ¥
# Challenge:
# Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, determine the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city.
# Instructions:
# Input: A list of cities with pairwise distances (e.g., [[0, 10, 15, 20, 25], [10, 0, 35, 25, 30], [15, 35, 0, 30, 5], [20, 25, 30, 0, 15], [25, 30, 5, 15, 0]]).
# Output: The length of the shortest route that visits each city once and returns to the origin.
# Test Cases:
# assert traveling_salesman([[0, 10, 15, 20, 25], [10, 0, 35, 25, 30], [15, 35, 0, 30, 5], [20, 25, 30, 0, 15], [25, 30, 5, 15, 0]]) == 80
# assert traveling_salesman([[0, 1, 2], [1, 0, 1], [2, 1, 0]]) == 3
# assert traveling_salesman([[0, 2, 9], [1, 0, 6], [3, 8, 0]]) == 15
